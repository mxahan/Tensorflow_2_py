# Contains code tutorial tips etc

Most of the codes were developed already. I plan to learn what is necessary for my research.

I don't claim any of the code as my original development. I ran and understand them in my own machine. I believe I can reproduce them hopefully.

I understand the Integrity in coding. Kudos to the original development.

But its not always convenient to site / keep track from where I am collecting materials.

Sorry! If I bitwisely upload any code developed by others. I hope this will not be the case. But still a caution.

**I don't claim to be the author of the codes in this repository. I am a learner.**
